# FuncTsï¼šA Functionalization Approach to Optimizing Graph-Level IR Based Tensor Program in Deep Learning

### TODOLIST
- [ ] Deep dive into AliasDb
- [ ] Add log info
- [ ] Define `immut` operator alias info
- [ ] Define memory SSA representation (`immut::access`, `immut::assign`)
- [ ] Completely support control flow
- [ ] Completely support container
