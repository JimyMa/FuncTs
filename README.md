# FuncTsï¼šA Functionalization Approach to Optimizing Graph-Level IR Based Tensor Program in Deep Learning

### TODOLIST

- [ ] Deep dive into AliasDb
- [X] Define `immut` operator `aliasInfo`, `inferShape`
- [ ] Define memory SSA representation (`immut::access`, `immut::assign`)
- [ ] Completely support control flow

  - [ ] Dealing with Loop Carried Dependency
- [ ] Completely support container
